                        "Bowenwork&reg; is a system of touch that initiates a series of responses through
                        stimulation of the
                        nervous, musculoskeletal, fascial and energetic systems of the human body ... The purpose of a
                        Bowenwork session is to activate the innate healing mechanisms within the body so that, given
                        time, the autonomic nervous system will self-regulate ... and the
                        body will heal to the extent it is able."<br>
