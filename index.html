                        "Bowenwork&reg; is a system of touch that initiates a series of responses through
                        stimulation of the
                        nervous, musculoskeletal, fascial and energetic systems of the human body ... The purpose of a
                        Bowenwork session is to activate the innate healing mechanisms within the body so that, given
                        time, the autonomic nervous system will self-regulate ... and the
                        body will heal to the extent it is able."<br>

                        Bowenwork&reg; as a client; it changed her life and she decided that she would try
                        to share Bowenwork&reg; with others.<br><br>
                        As a coach and sports parent, Yolanda has extensive experience working with athletes.
                        And dealing with athletic-related injuries.<br><br>
                        As a breast cancer survivor, she adamantly recommends Bowenwork&reg; for gentle support during
                        chemo and after surgery.<br><br>
